# Moodle
I created a few scripts to make using moodle a bit easier. The main features are currently automatic redirection to the login form and the dashboard.

## Usage
Clone this repository and go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions). Click `Load unpacked extension` and navigate to the cloned repository.

The script is optimized for small screens like laptops and automatically redirects to the dashboard when logged in.

Feel free to open pull requests and use these scripts.

## Open PDFs inline
Install the [render-pdfs-inline](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/render-pdfs-inline-for-be/mpmmilbhemhehclnkpkfepmaikiolaab) extension to use the Chrome pdf viewer instead of downloading pdfs.
